# Road Map
Road map for barium
## Features that are going to be added
- (Website related) SQL database with support for serializing all fabric mods on Curseforge.
Same thing but for Modrinth too.
- Making the database open source, so other projects can use it too (Auto-updating in a git repo?)
- /download and /update commands
## Features that might not be added
- Automatic Update (When game close after a certain perioud of time (eg. 7 days))
- Automatic dependency download (just adds another layer of things to parse, so could make the API slower)
